# Udacity Data Analyst Term 1 Project: Analyze A/B Test Results
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Some descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to the data set in order to drive conclusions from the data set. In the end, a liner regression model was built in order to help understand what drives conversions. 

# How to run the script
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE). This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. The code was written in Jupyter Notebook.
